# project-description

 Our project is a _web-app_ that allows specific users to create a to-do-list to sort a given list of tasks. By hosting this application on the web multiple individual are able to contribute in doing tasks aswell as assigning task. With further development this could potential be utilized in a small office enviorment. Currently we have it running on a local host, due to the cost of hosting this item online.

# installation

In order to install this web-app you must first download the files from the **github repository**.
After doing so you will need to install a few additionally tools to run the appliaction. 

# configuration

The configuration for this _web-app_ is as follows. Utilizing _php & sql_ we are able to create a backend that saves individual user information. This information is used in order to identify specific <sup> Task List </sup>. Additionally as mentioned in the **_installation_** section, there are specific tools that must be set up prior to use on a local machine. 

# license

For styling we have used the **_7.css_** style sheet, which is protected under the **_MIT_** license. This helped us achive the older aesthetic.

# demo
